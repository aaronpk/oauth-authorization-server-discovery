1.  Introduction

   In order to obtain an access token to access a resource server, an
   OAuth 2.0 client needs to know the authorization server to use for
   the request.  [RFC6749] does not provide any mechanisms for
   authorization server discovery, and other OAuth 2.0 extensions have
   left authorization server discovery out of scope as well.

   This specification provides a mechanism for a resource server to
   indicate which authorization server it accepts access tokens from, so
   that an OAuth client can be configured with only the location of the
   resource server.

   For example, an email client could provide an interface for a user to
   enter the URL of their JMAP server.  The email client would make a
   request to the server to discover the authorization server, then
   initiate an OAuth authorization flow to obtain tokens.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
